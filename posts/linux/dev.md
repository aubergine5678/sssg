Simple Tools for Development Environment
========================================
Setting up a development environment

Window Manager
--------------
Tiling window manager, [dwm][dwm]

### dwmstatus

Simple status bar for [dwm][dwm], not click-able, not colour-able. Use a simple
C script to lower the processing cost as it runs every second.

[dwm]: //dwm.suckless.org

Terminal
--------
I use [st](//st.suckless.org) as it is fast and support true colors (my
ultimate motive). I use it with solarized (base16).

Editor
------
#### **Note: I am not a participatant of the editor wars, I use vi-like keys just to prevent _»little-finger ache«_**

[neovim](//neovim.org) as a stylish vi-editor with fast
[vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) as the plugin manager.
